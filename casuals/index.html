<h1>Facilities</h1>

<h2 id="staffcards">Staff Cards and Building Access</h2>

<p>Your University staff card is your access to the Melbourne School of Design, including all external doors, staff spaces, classrooms and computer labs. Your staff card is also your on-campus identification. Carry it with you at all times. Do not let anyone else use your staff card.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your contract is renewed you will need to log a request via the Facilities online request form (see below) to have your access reinstated.</p>

<p>• To have your card printed, take a copy of your contract and photo ID to Access Control located at 213 Grattan Street.<br />
• To have your card activated, <a href="https://staff.unimelb.edu.au/abp/facilities/facilities-requests">log a request</a> via the Facilities page on the ABP intranet (You will need your username and password to login).<br />
• Please allow 72 hours for the request to process and your card to begin working.</p>

<h2 id="lecternkeys">Lectern Keys</h2>

<p>Lectern (LEC) keys open lecterns and computer cabinets across campus. Under the new operating model, LEC keys are now the responsibility of the subject coordinator or senior tutor to distribute and collect from their tutors at the beginning and end of semesters. The facilities office no longer has the resources to hand out the LEC keys to each individual tutor. You return your LEC keys to the facilities office at the end of your contract or when you leave the University.</p>

<h2 id="lockers">Lockers</h2>

<p>Lockers will be allocated to eligible staff each semester based on order of application. Preference is provided to casual and sessional staff who do not have access to the bike store or do not have a permanent work point with secure storage.</p>

<ul>
	<li>full name</li>
	<li>staff ID number</li>
	<li>position (ie: tutor)</li>

	<li>contract details (start/end date)</li>
	<li>name of your supervisor</li>
	<li>contact details (mobile phone and email address)</li>
	<li>locker location preference (MSD Bldg Level 4, Baldwin Spencer Bldg G42)</li>
